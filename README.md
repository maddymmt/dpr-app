# QA with DPR

To test the DPR with your academic PDF, you could ask questions that target the specific content within that document. Here are some types of questions you might consider:

1. **Definitional**: "What is the definition of [specific term]?"
2. **Explanatory**: "How does [process/phenomenon] work according to [study/paper name]?"
3. **Statistical**: "What statistics are mentioned about [topic]?"
4. **Comparative**: "How does [concept A] differ from [concept B] in the context of [field or study]?"
5. **Methodological**: "What methods were used in the study to [perform an experiment/analyze data]?"
6. **Result-Oriented**: "What were the findings or conclusions of [study/paper name] regarding [specific topic]?"

For instance, if your PDF is about agricultural techniques, you might ask:

- "What are the modern techniques for pest control mentioned in the document?"
- "According to the paper, what are the benefits of vertical farming?"

These questions are designed to probe different sections of the paper and require the DPR to understand and retrieve information from specific parts of the text.
